# 3-Chest-game
Contains 3 Chests game

Imagine you play a game. The host of the game gives you 3 chests
and says that one of the chests contains a treasure, and if you guess it correctly
the treasure is yours. After you choose, he will help you a little bit, (or confuse, it depends 
on your understanding of how probability works) he will take back the chest that does not contain
the treasure from 2 chests that you did not choose, and will give a chance to you to think again.

The question is, will you change your choice?

This simple project allows you to check how many times will you win if you change your choice
and how many times if you won't. 

It also allows you to play the game yourself, and choose whether to change your choice or not.

Just run Source.cpp file!

Enjoy)
